Render is not properly working as a hosting service.
I have spent four hours trying to set it up, I have fixed
every error and the app is finally "live", properly working.
However, the URL simply is loading indefinitely.  I suspect
this is an issue on our end, and therefore there is nothing
at all we can do about it.

As part of the github i have included the following:
URL: https://exchange-rate-explorer-dash-app.onrender.com/
just in case it decides to start working again
render dashboard:
https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-clsapirip8as739pfl40/deploys/dep-clscvrdetvis73b86lhg
I have also included an image as proof.
